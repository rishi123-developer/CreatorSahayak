# Project Name: CreatorSahayak (AI for Bharat)

## 1. Problem Statement
Content creation in India is booming, but many regional creators struggle with:
* Writing engaging scripts in native languages (Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, etc.).
* Designing high-CTR thumbnails without expensive graphic designers.
* Understanding SEO (Tags, Titles, Descriptions) to rank on YouTube.
* Existing tools are mostly English-centric and expensive.

## 2. Proposed Solution
**CreatorSahayak** is an AI-powered assistant designed specifically for Indian creators ("Bharat ke Creators"). It uses Generative AI to automate the pre-production process.

### Key Features:
1.  **Multilingual Script Generator:** Users input a topic (e.g., "Vlog in Vadodara"), and the AI generates a full script in Hindi/Gujarati/Hinglish.
2.  **AI Thumbnail Ideation:** Generates prompt descriptions for thumbnails based on the script's hook.
3.  **SEO Optimizer:** Auto-generates high-ranking Titles, Tags, and Descriptions relevant to Indian audiences.
4.  **Trend Analyzer:** Suggests trending topics in specific Indian regions.

## 3. Target Audience
* YouTubers and Instagram Reel creators in Tier 2 & Tier 3 cities.
* Regional language educators and entertainers.
* Small business owners looking to market via video.

## 4. Technology Stack
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python) or React Native (Mobile).
* **AI Model (Text):** Gemini Pro (via Google AI Studio) for script writing and translations.
* **AI Model (Image):** Gemini (Multimodal) or Stable Diffusion for thumbnail concept generation.
* **Backend:** Python (FastAPI/Flask).
* **Database:** Firebase or SQLite.

## 5. Impact
* Democratizes content creation for non-English speakers.
* Reduces video production time by 70%.
* Empowers "Digital India" by helping local creators go global.
